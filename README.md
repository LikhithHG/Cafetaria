# CAFETARIA AUTOMATION SYSTEM

#Note that only basic functionality for ordering food using android application is implemented. There was a simple paypal dummy payment gateway portal was integrated during our project.

# Project Description
 **Android based Cafetaria Management System** that aims to digitalize the process of various restaurant operations including **customer ordering, managing the orders from restaurant end**. 

The main purpose is to **improve the performance** of the restaurant by eradicating the daily paperwork. With this system the tasks
would be performed in less amount of time and more efficiently. An additional benefit of this software is that during the rush hours the load can be balanced effectively, and restaurants would perform better than usual. In addition to this, human error that occurs when performing tasks manually is also minimized and presence of queues in the system to assign tasks to chefs can reduce congestion in the kitchen. The system would also result in reduction of labor which would result in the reduction of expenses of the restaurant. Feedback module would help the restaurant check for how well they are performing, and monthly/yearly figures can be checked by the billing module to see the trends in sales and profits. These benefits can potentially result in generation of more revenues for the restaurant. 

## Purpose
This application was developed as a mini project for our **Department of Information Science** . The whole class was divided into teams of 3 members. This exercise made us familiar with the issues that occur during the integration of modules in real software projects like following consistent database schema, variable names, libraries versions etc.
